Empowerment is viewed as a process of activating patients, who as a result of rejecting the passivity of sick role behavior and assuming responsibility for their care by involving their treatment decisions. However as empowerment is focused on how to help patients to become more knowledgeable and take control on their own health, there are many debates on the actual outcomes of it.  It is argued that empowerment and control are not the same things; there are many factors that might affect decision-making capacity of patients, such as need for security, self-determination, and a continuous sense of self. Even though patient empowerment can be perceived as desirable, it can also be constraining. Patient might experience more scepticism, anxiety, fear, and in some case empowerment might be an indicator that the patient is avoiding awareness of the impact of illness on his/her life.

We will query tweeter data for selected keywords for breast cancer. Query results (hashtags) would be analysed according to a set of criteria including number of followers, or re-tweets.
